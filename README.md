# CoffeeShopUsingGui

This is a coffee shop application using Graphical User Interface. <br />
This program is designed to demonstrate the convenience of using GUI for the end user by providing pages and buttons. <br/>
This can be used by customers or cafe workers to make their life easier by providing all the options and specifications. <br/>
Coffee shop has `Special Drip`, `Espresso`, and `Dessert` that user can choose. <br />
After placing an order, the user can check what they have ordered and see the `Total Amount`, `Tax`, and `Grand Total` of their order.

## Main Menu
The user has an option to click `Speical Drip`, `Espresso`, `Dessert`, or `Cart`. <br/>
